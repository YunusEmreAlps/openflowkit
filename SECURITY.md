## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within OpenFlowKit, please do NOT create a public GitHub issue.

 Instead, please report it via email to [varun@example.com] (replace with your actual email or security contact method).

We will create a fix and release a patch as soon as possible.
